  ## Motivation
  I personally, had difficulty remembering songs I had practiced in my early days playing the guitar, with this program, I aim to help strengthen muscle memory, and keep a diverse and numerous "song bank" to play at will.

  Searching by Band name:
  
  cout << "Enter the band: ";

		getline(songsOut, c, '^');
		getline(songsOut, far);
		if(band == bandEntry)
		{
			isFound = true;
